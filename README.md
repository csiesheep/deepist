# DeepIST

*DeepIST* aims to predict the travel time of a given path (i.e., a sequence of road segments) in a road network. 
Please refer the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05637.pdf).


## Prepare

### Map matching for trajectories

### Parse map matching results as paths

### Plot paths as images
